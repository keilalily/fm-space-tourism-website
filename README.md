## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Working on this challenge allowed me to deepen my understanding of React and Tailwind CSS. Specifically, I improved my ability to:
- Build responsive layouts with Tailwind CSS utility classes, ensuring that the design adapts well across various screen sizes.
- Customize Tailwind's configuration to extend themes, such as adjusting breakpoints, adding custom fonts, and defining unique color schemes.
- Optimize component styling in React by effectively combining Tailwind with conditional classes and dynamic state changes.
- Manage active states and conditionally display sections in React, especially when switching between tabs and paginations.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue improving my skills with both React and Tailwind CSS. I want to focus more on:
- Advanced React State Management: Although Iâ€™ve learned to handle active states, I can improve my understanding of more complex state management solutions such as Context API or state management libraries like Redux for larger applications.
- Accessibility (A11Y): Improving the accessibility of my applications by ensuring proper use of semantic HTML and ARIA roles would enhance the user experience for all users.
- Backend Development and Integration
